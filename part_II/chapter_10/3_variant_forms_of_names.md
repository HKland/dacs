# 10.3 Variant Forms of Names

Commentary: Variant names are created to help users discover materials that have been classified under one name but a user might reasonably expect to find material using another name. Make a _see_ reference from a form of the name of a person or corporate body or title of a work that might reasonably be sought to the form that has been chosen as the name or uniform title heading or as a title entry.
